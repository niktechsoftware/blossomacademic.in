                                            <p class="main">True education releases capacities, develops analytical abilities, confidence, will and goal-setting competencies and instills the vision serving the best interest of the community.</p>
 
 <p class="main">It’s my pleasure and privilege to as a director of “BLOSSOM ACADEMIC SCHOOL” not only because of contouring it but also because I enjoy the company of my dearly loved students and talented laborious teachers who keep me energized all the time.</p>
  <p class="main">BAS is not just one more school in the already long list of educational institutions in the GHAZIPUR district, But it is One school which has made a great difference in its Qualitative journey of over these years.</p>
  <p class="main">Our children’s represent our hopes and dreams. As parent, you certainly want the best for your child and we are indeed happy to be working with you to ensure that they are given the right knowledge to face future challenges. </p>
   <p class="main">The management, parents, students and the teaching fraternity are a team and complement each other efforts. We try to create an atmosphere of reverence for education and a healthy environment where academic, sports and co-curricular facilities mould our students and motivate them to be the brightest and the best, in order to do this, the school works towards inculcating certain values in the students in order to enrich their mind and spirit and also to develop essential moral attributes like truthfulness, courtesy, generosity, compassion, justice, love and truth worthiness in them.</p>
    <p class="main">This is what we at BAS are striving to do. Our role is identical to that of a gardener and we strive to perform this role to the best of our ability by nurturing these ‘Seeds’ at school so that they bear the ‘Best Fruits’ in the years to come.</p>
     <p class="main">I am very grateful to each and every member of BAS, our students who constantly show their performance and conduct that makes a difference to be a student of blossom academy. Last but not the least Our parents whose trust inspires us to move ahead.</p>
     <h3 style="color:#983327">We wish you and your child a very rewarding experience at Blossom Academic School.</h3>
